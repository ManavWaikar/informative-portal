            <h1>  </h1>
            <p> 
                In this fast-moving world the most important thing is data or information. 
                It is very important that the data or information which is presented to 
                people should be in simple, effective and understandable format.
                Many time we come across situations where important information is 
                being provided to us but we tend to ignore or overlook it as the way  
                it is being presented is not attractive. Similarly, many times less relevant 
                or important information is presented to us in manner such that we willingly
                get engaged into it even if it doesn’t have much significance.
                </p>

            <p> In order to provide the data or information in simple, effective and understandable format
                I have decided to make a portal “Information Portal”. That is, I will be preparing a website
                which would deliver information to people in effective way. Operators will be able to surf 
                over different pages and gather information regarding different places across us.
                All-important data regarding imp places will be listed in portal in very attractive way.
            </p>
