                        For me, India Gate will always be one of the most beautiful landmarks in the world, 
                        no matter what time you visit it.

                        I climbed the stairs to the very top several times in my youth before it was closed 
                        to the public. The last time was when I was 17. The view is spectacular - not only 
                        of the immediate grounds, but beyond as well.
